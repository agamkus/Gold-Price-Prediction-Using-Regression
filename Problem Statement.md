# Gold-Price-Prediction-Using-Regression
Gold always plays an important role in the growth of a country. There are always fall and rise in the gold price due to the market change and thus the economy gets affected.

Here, we have been provided with 19 years of data having datewise Gold Price in 3 different currencies:
- USD
- GBP
- Euro

We have to understand and analyze the dataset and make a predictive model which can predict the price of gold for an unseen data.

We are going to do a lot of EDA and preprocessing to make the data in understandable and suitable format. Also, we are going to have some data visualization to get insight from the data.
